This project aims to design a user-friendly FTP platform, on which user can connect to FTP server using TCP protocol, receive FTP server’s replies in natural language, login with username and hidden password, and send commands, including ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, put, get, delete, rename, transfer mode and quit, etc. The platform needs to handle errors to avoid user’s improper manner or network problems. Moreover, the platform implements extension functions, including restrict transmission rate and breakpoint transmission.
