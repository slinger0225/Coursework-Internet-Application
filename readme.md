This project aims to help students to deeply understand how two hosts to establish FTP connection and how FTP constructions operate, which is based on Linux command line terminal. It requires us to design a user friendly FTP operation platform, on which user can connect FTP server using TCP protocol, receive FTP server replies in natural language, login with username and hidden password, and send commands in natural language, which includes ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, put, get, delete, rename, transfer mode and quit, etc. The platform needs to handle errors to avoid user’s improper operation or network problems according to the return number. Moreover, the platform implements extension functions, including restrict transmission rate and breakpoint transmission.
